# Checkout Use Case

SnapWallet supports checkouts for your organization.

In order to embed the widget for checkouts, set a description on the configuration to describe what is being purchased and where the money is being sent to.

i.e. "Rooster John Wick #32 sold by CryptoRoosters via OpenSea"

The amount can be fixed or enterable by the user.
