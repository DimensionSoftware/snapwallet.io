WYRE-NOTES

That depends on how we plan to maintain credentials, if we want to use centralized credentials (single api key + secret) then yes, if not then we need to generate a token for every user and submit it to https://docs.sendwyre.com/docs/initialize-auth-token in exchange for the api key (client generated secret.)
The first way limits us so that we cannot allow customers to have special deals with Wyre (lower fees etc.) which is probably ok
There isn't really a limitation to the second method and I feel it is more secure in case the centralized credentials are swooped (every user has different credentials.)
The flow would look something like
1. Generate secret (varchar 35)
2. Store secret + API Key from response
3. Create account using either a signature https://docs.sendwyre.com/docs/authentication or use the user's secret as the bearer token
4. Store UserAccount with external ID
5. Subscribe to changes on the account  https://docs.sendwyre.com/docs/subscribe-webhook (edited)
